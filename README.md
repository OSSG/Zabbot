# Zabbot

**Zabbot** is a Jabber bot for [Zabbix](https://www.zabbix.com/) monitoring software. It can obtain information from Zabbix server with JSON requests and answer questions about monitoring hosts' conditions and events.

**Zabbot** built upon *Jabbot* primitive and easy-to-extend framework for building Jabber bots.
Not to be confused with lots of other projects called *Jabbot*. This one is developing by OSS Group. ;-)
